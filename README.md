# MAIN-WEBSITE
This is my website, I used a bunch of tools to create this website

## TOOLS
-react 

## LIBRARIES
- react-router-dom
- framer-motion (for animations and page transitions)
- email.js (for sending direct messages to me)
- react icons

## FEATURES
- In page animations
- Smooth Page Transition
- A section where visitors can send a direct email to me
- A section where my projects and the details are shown
- A section where my resume is shown

## PROCESSES
- The website loads with a intro-section animation, giving the visitor my informations
- useRef, useEffect and useInview where used to trigger each of the animations when in view or out of view,
so when you scroll into any section, the section animates in and vice versa when the the visitor scrolls out of the section
 
- in the main page there is link that leads to the resume page and my projects page
- clicking the link triggers a cool page transition that i used AnimatePresence from the framer-motion library to implement.

- When in the resume page you you have the choice to download the whole resume as a pdf if you like
- In the project page, there is an overview of some of the projects I have worked on in the past, and below there is a carousel that shows the details and the link to each of the projects

- This site is also mobile responsive across all types of screen
